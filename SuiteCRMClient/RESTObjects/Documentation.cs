/// Much of this package has not been touched during the major refactoring undertaken in 2017. 
/// Classes which have not been touched typically still have a hungarian-notation lower case 'e' prefix.
/// Generally, classes represent directly the JSON messages sent to and from the SuiteCRM JSON API. Few
/// of these classes have any significant code.
